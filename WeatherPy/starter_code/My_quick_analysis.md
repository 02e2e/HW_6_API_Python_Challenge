# HW_6_API_Python_Challenge

* For Part 1, you must include a written description of three observable trends based on the data.

* Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
- Both hemispheres have dips in their max temp as you move towards 90(northern) -90(southern). As you approach the equater the max temp increases.
* Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
- Lower humidity outliers are seen b/w -20 to 45 latitude. 
* Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
- Not sure what can be extrapolated from this representation of cloudcover. 
* Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude
- The higest speed ouliters are seen at the about 15 degrees and 50 degrees latitude. At about 40-50 degrees you see a cluster of similar windspeeds. 

* For Part 2, you must take a screenshot of the heatmap that you create and include it in your submission.
